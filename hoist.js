// One of the advantages you get from JavaScript putting function 
// declarations into memory first, before it executes any coding, 
// is this allows you to use a function before you declare it in your coding. 

catName("Chloe");

function catName(name) {
  console.log("My cats name is " + name);
}
/*
The results of the coding above is: "My cats name is Chloe"
*/
